<b>BugFinder</b> inspection aims to locate complex (and possibly buggy) patterns in your Python code.
It works with patterns represented in Python Flow Graphs, which were mined by
<a href="https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/code-change-miner">code-change-miner</a> tool. Actually,
inspection tries to find isomorphic subgraphs of patterns in yours program control flow graph, which is built
automatically.
